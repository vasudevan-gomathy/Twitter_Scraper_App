# Twitter_Scraper_App

Today, data is scattered everywhere in the world. Especially in social media, there may be a big quantity of data on Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, Twitter, etc. This consists of pictures and films on Youtube and Instagram as compared to Facebook and Twitter. To get the real facts on Twitter, we want to scrape the data from Twitter. As a fellow Data Enthusiast, I have created user friendly Scraper App where you can easily obtain data from twitter.

## About the App
This App contains the feature to enter the keyword or Hashtag to be searched, select the date range and limit the tweet count need to be scraped. After scraping, the data will be displayed in the page and has a button to upload the data into MongoDB Database and download the data into csv format.

The Scraper creates a dataframe with:
-date, 
-id, 
-url, 
-tweet content, 
-user,
-reply count, 
-retweet count,
-language, 
-source, 
-like count.
